              <p class ="dark"> Thank you for taking the time to look at my website! I am a fourth year student at the University of Victoria.
                I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Combined Computer Science and Psychology.
                Coding has been a new interest for me, but it deems rewarding. I am taking the next few steps in life
                to expand my knowledge and grow as a developer.To sum me up in a few words, I'd say that I am a happy-go-lucky girl who goes with the flow.
                If you would like to know more, please feel free to explore my <a href="about.html">about</a> page. </p>
