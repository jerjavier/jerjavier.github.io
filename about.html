            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Jeralyn Javier. I was born in Guam, USA and grew up in BC
            on the beautiful Vancouver Island. I am on track to completing my BSc in
          Combined Computer Science and Psychology. I first pursued a Psychology degree,
        but later found an interest for coding. This website is my first personal project.
          It has been quite a rollercoaster trying to discover what I want to achieve for my career goals.
        I have finally decided that I want to pursue a career in UX/UI design. This is would ideal. I would love
      to apply my growing knowledge of computer science and psychology to projects where I can express myself more
    artistically. I enjoy human interaction, creativity, and logic, so it really completes
  everything I love.</p>
              <p class ="dark">Some values that I have are to be kind and positive.
              I like to appreciate the days that we have and not take any experience
              for granted. Every experience is a learning opportunity. Family and friends
            are also very important to me as they are the best support systems to have. I hope to
          prosper in many aspects in my life as I have been discovering new enjoyments to fulfill my goals.</p>

          					<p>I have been wanting to paddleboard for the longest time
                       but have always been scared to try it because I don't know
                       how to swim. Strangely enough, I still love the big blue ocean.
                       I tried paddleboarding for the first time this past summer
                       and needless to say, I have a new found love.</p>

          					<p>Covid has most definitely been a struggle, but there have
                    a few been moments where I thought to myself that it's also a blessing in disguise.
                  I have rediscovered my love for painting and was able to express
                my artistic side during the beginning of our pandemic. This is one
              of the first paintings I did when I started. I hope to look back at
            this and think about how I've improved over the years.</p>

          					<p>Being an islander is one of my favorite things about my life.
                    It seems as if every corner you go to, there is a beach. You can
                  go such a little distance and still have such a beautiful view.
                I enjoy hiking as well and this one was just a little stroll on the gulf
              islands. An adventure with a view.</p>
